Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `Asynchronous FFmpeg` for local development.

1. Fork the `asyncffmpeg` repo on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally:

   ```console
   git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/asyncffmpeg.git
   ```

3. Install your local copy into a virtualenv. Assuming you have Pipenv installed, this is how you set up your fork for local development:

   ```console
   pipenv install --dev
   ```

4. Create a branch for local development:

   ```console
   git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
   ```

   Now you can make your changes locally.

5. When you're done making changes,
   check that your changes pass isort, flake8, black,
   and the tests, including testing oldest Python version:

   ```console
   pipenv run inv style --check
   pipenv run pytest
   pipenv install --python 3.9
   pipenv run pytest
   ```

6. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub:

   ```console
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
   git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
   ```

7. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

## Pull Request Guidelines

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests.
2. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put
   your new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add the
   feature to the list in README.md.

## Tips

To run a subset of tests:

```console
pipenv run pytest tests.test_asyncffmpeg

```

## Deploying

A reminder for the maintainers on how to deploy.
Make sure all your changes are committed.
Then run:

```console
bump2version patch # possible: major / minor / patch
git push
git push --tags
```

Travis will then deploy to PyPI if tests pass.
